			<p>Create Eye-Catching Output
Altova StyleVision 2008 features a unique
graphical design interface for creating
stylesheets to transform XML and database
data into multiple output formats. Because
StyleVision produces standards-conformant
XSLT 1.0, XSLT 2.0, and XSL:FO stylesheets,
plus HTML, Word/RTF, PDF, and Authentic
form output simultaneously, based on one
design, developers and designers no longer
need to spend countless hours hand-coding
and testing intricate stylesheets to implement
single source publishing and database
reporting solutions.</p>

			<heading>Visual Stylesheet Design</heading>
			<p>Writing even the simplest transformation stylesheets manually is a difficult, time-consuming
process. It requires an understanding of XSL elements, the XPath language, and complicated
rules-based document processing models. StyleVision 2008 abstracts away the tricky
underlying syntax, allowing you to compose stylesheets using a visual design interface,
which is easier to learn, takes considerably less time, reduces the occurrence of errors,
and lets you focus on the creativity of your design. The designs you create in StyleVision
can be based on any DTD, XML Schema, or relational database, and multiple sources are
supported. For instance, you can create one design that includes data from both XML and
database sources.</p>
			<p>The unified design approach promoted by StyleVision allows you to implement true single
source publishing, since one easy-to-create design simultaneously produces HTML,
Word/RTF, PDF, and electronic form output.When your source data changes, the HTML,
Word/RTF, and PDF output can be updated simultaneously with the click of a button.</p>

			<heading>Advanced Styles and Functions</heading>
			<p>Applying eye-catching styles and advanced functionality to your
designs is easy with StyleVision's drag-and-drop design process and
intelligent entry-helpers. To create a design, you simply drag elements
from your data source(s) onto the design pane, and StyleVision 2008
prompts you with options for rendering the content. You can insert
static content, such as headers, images, etc., directly into your design,
then insert elements from XML and database sources that will be
rendered dynamically based on the source data.You can even re-use
portions of existing design files when creating new designs. To help
you apply layout and style information to the content in your design,
StyleVision includes advanced entry-helper windows and dialog
boxes for viewing and editing source elements and styles. Design
styles can be applied using drag-and-drop functionality or by editing
properties directly in the entry-helpers.</p>
			<p>For HTML Web page design, StyleVision supports all the elements
found on today's advanced Web pages, including hyperlinks, CSS
(cascading stylesheets), JavaScript functions, and more. It even
includes a JavaScript editor for defining functions that add dynamic,
event-based functionality to your HTML pages.</p>
			<p>StyleVision allows you to apply CSS styles on a local or global basis
using drop-down menus and dialog boxes, and you can also import
an external CSS stylesheet to apply previously created rules to your
StyleVision design. CSS styles are applied to your HTML output,
and most translate to Word/RTF and PDF output as well.</p>
			<p>The table of contents capability, complete with its TOC wizard and
context-sensitive right click menu, makes StyleVision even more
attractive for single source, multi-channel publishing. This is especially
true for publishing large documents, which may have source
content in XML or databases and require tables of contents when
output to HTML, Word, and/or PDF.</p>
			<p>In addition to defining advanced style and layout conditions,
StyleVision allows you to design stylesheets and Authentic forms that
support advanced functions such as complex table handling, rich
input formatting, business logic validation, date control, and more.
All these features, combined with the ease of visual, drag-anddrop
design, make StyleVision an invaluable tool for Web developers
and others who need to publish XML and database content in
online and print media.</p>

		<heading>Further Highlights</heading>
		<subchapter>
			<heading>Database Report Generation</heading>
			<p>Because StyleVision 2008 allows you to base
your design on a relational database (in addition
to a DTD or XML Schema), it's easy to design
database reports with output to HTML, Word/RTF,
and PDF. A new Database Query window allows
you to easily connect to and query databases from
within the application.What's more, StyleVision
2008 works directly with XML data stored inside
IBM DB2 9 databases. Users simply associate
database XML fields with XML Schemas, then
drag elements onto the design pane for rendering
and publishing.</p>
		</subchapter>
		<subchapter>
			<heading>Standards-conformant Stylesheet Creation</heading>
			<p>Based on your visual design, StyleVision 2008 auto-generates multiple
transformation stylesheets to convert your XML and database data
to HTML, Word/RTF, and PDF. StyleVision supports XSLT 1.0 and
XSL:FO, as well as the powerful XSLT 2.0 stylesheet specification.
XSLT 2.0 support is XML Schema-aware, providing additional mechanisms
for error isolation and enhanced code performance. Based on
your choice of XSLT 1.0 or 2.0, StyleVision auto-generates the XSLT
code and XPath 1.0 or 2.0 selectors required to build your stylesheets.
This automated design approach speeds stylesheet creation and all
but negates the occurrence of errors.</p>
		<p>At any time during the design process, you can view and save the
XSLT and XSL:FO stylesheets that are built behind the scenes
based on your design. Since they are standards-based, you can
use these stylesheets in other applications as needed.</p>

		<subchapter>
			<heading>HTML to XML Conversion</heading>
			<p>To leverage existing Web content, StyleVision 2008 includes a
handy HTML importer for converting HTML to XML. Using simple
drag-and-drop functionality, you can quickly
convert an HTML page to an XML Schema,
XSLT 1.0 or 2.0 stylesheet, and XML instance
document. This feature adds extensibility to
your current HTML content, which can now
be used in XML-based applications and output
in Word/RTF, PDF, and Altova Authentic
form formats.</p>
		</subchapter>
		<subchapter>
			<heading>Authentic Form Creation</heading>
			<p>In addition to rendering attractive HTML, Word/RTF, and PDF output,
each design you create in StyleVision 2008 can also produce an
Authentic form for use with Altova Authentic 2008. Authentic is a free
XML and database content editor that allows non-technical business
users to access and edit content in XML documents and relational
databases without being exposed to the underlying technology. They
simply fill in electronic forms created in StyleVision, and the source
XML documents or databases are automatically accessed and
updated behind the scenes.</p>
		<p>Because your design also simultaneously
produces XSLT and XSL:FO
stylesheets along with the Authentic
form, you can output the data entered
through the form directly to HTML,
Word/RTF, and PDF without having
to design additional stylesheets.

			<heading>Unlock Corporate Knowledge</heading>
			<p>Altova Authentic 2008 offers an innovative approach to XML and
database content editing that completely shields the end user from
the underlying technology. Authentic presents non-technical business
users with electronic forms that allow them to view and enter valid
XML or database data using intuitive, WYSIWYG forms. These
electronic Authentic forms are created by designers using Altova
StyleVision 2008.</p>
			<p>Authentic forms can be based on any DTD, XML Schema, or relational
database. And, since Authentic is offered under a free license, you
can distribute the Authentic forms interface to as many end users as
required free of charge.</p>

			<heading>XML and Database Content Editing</heading>
			<p>Authentic 2008 is available as a FREE download in Desktop and
Browser Editions. The Desktop Edition is an independently managed
client application, while the Browser Edition provides similar viewing
and editing capabilities in a lightweight plug-in component that runs
inside the Internet Explorer browser.</p>

			<heading>Industry Template Support</heading>
			<p>In addition to supporting Authentic forms created with StyleVision 2008,
Authentic 2008 includes built-in templates for saving data according
to industry XML standards such as DITA (Darwin Information Typing
Architecture), DocBook, NITF (News Industry Text Format), NewsML
(News Markup Language), and many others. Using the Authentic
templates, non-technical users can quickly edit and save data that is
valid according to these widely-used schemas.</p>
