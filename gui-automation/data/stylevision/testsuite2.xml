		<editelementtext>A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is a story that is rich in metaphors that ultimately questions the morals and ethics of society during the time of his life. In the story, Ebenezer Scrooge, is a greedy but rich accountant who is visited by his old business partners ghost Jacob Marley tells Scrooge that he may face penalty of becoming a lost soul if he continues to value money more than anything else in his life. He also foretells Scrooge will be visited by three other ghost that will give him the chance to redeem himself and he can break the iron chain of greed that he has woven. The plot, story, and the end of this book shows that it was well written and well thought up by the author. This book also show Dickens works are some of the best of our time. Ebenezer Scrooge a miserly, cold- hearted creditor, continues his stingy, greedy ways on Christmas Eve.
